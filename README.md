## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- **Clean Architecture** implementation
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach
- **Unit testing** with comprehensive coverage
- **Repository pattern** with data sources
- **Error handling** with custom exceptions and failures
- **Mock testing** using Mocktail

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application implementing Clean Architecture.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## ** To Add the Screenshot:**

1. **Make sure the screenshot exists** at `/Users/adityaanand/Developer/flutter_project/clean_architecture_tdd/screenshots/image.png`

2. **Create the screenshots directory** if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p screenshots
   ```

3. **Copy your screenshot** to that location

4. **The README will automatically display** the screenshot when viewed on GitHub/GitLab

## ** Benefits of Adding the Screenshot:**

- **Visual proof** of your test coverage
- **Professional appearance** for your project
- **Easy understanding** of what the project achieves
- **Documentation** of your testing success

The screenshot will be displayed inline in your README, making it easy for other developers to see your test coverage results at a glance! ðŸ“Šâœ¨

## Testing

Run the tests with coverage:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

Generate HTML coverage report:
```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

## Dependencies

- **dartz**: Functional programming with Either
- **equatable**: Value equality
- **mocktail**: Mocking for tests
- **shared_preferences**: Local storage
- **data_connection_checker_nulls**: Network connectivity
